# Uni Search #
Hi! We're team from University of Malaya and this is our solution in Google Solution Challenge 2020!:heart_eyes:

## Challenge we're looking to solve ##
The challenge we’re trying to solve is helping pre-university students to find their suitable course or higher education institution. In Malaysia, there is no such tool for students to look into the courses provided by each university. One has to go website by website to see the information for 1 particular course to compare them. 
 
Hence, our team came out with the idea of aggregating all necessary information searched by students then rendering them in a neat and organised way. Here born the Uni Search. 
 
Uni Search allows users to filter the options e.g. course, minimum CGPA, minimum Muet Band(English test for entering higher education) and location then see the results available for the course or university that they are looking for. 
 
The technologies behind Uni Search include HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, Firebase and Sheets API. Simple, isn’t it?:sunglasses: 
 
As such, any student who is looking for information about a course or university/college in Malaysia can just go to Uni Search to perform the search and choose the course or university that best fits them, just within seconds! 
 
## Steps we took to test our solution ##
Firstly, we found out that most of our juniors who are studying pre-university programs are having problems in choosing courses and universities since the UPU has opened the door for pre-university students to apply for UPU 2020/2021. 
 
To confirm the demand for this tool in Malaysia, we created a google form and viral it to our juniors to see their responses.This is the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLnmC_4rTUSQnAs2e5fdJP9_D129BAEtBOA1f3khrGxssK-fwm5bC74Z2nVGTkuY4QZSVMII2-NfNB/pubhtml). 
 
According to the survey, they show a strong demand for more tools to help them in finding the best course or university. Since choosing a course or a university can be a life-changing decision, hence, we decided to build this tool to solve this society problem so there will be no more students who register the courses that they are indeed not interested in. 
 
Along the way, we exchanged ideas of the data structure and the technologies we should use to make this product user-friendly and efficient to build. We opted for HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to build the application since we have some knowledge in these technologies and were interested to dive deeper into it. Whereas we used Firebase and Google Sheets API to manage the data about the courses and universities efficiently. The data collected was stored in Google Sheets and using the Google Sheets API, we synced the data to a realtime database in Firebase which is accessed to display output to users based on the options they filter.
