# Uni Search #
Hi! We're team from University of Malaya! This is our solution in Google Solution Challenge 2020!

## Challenge we're looking to solve ##
The challenge we’re trying to solve is helping pre-university students to find their suitable course or higher education institution. In Malaysia, there is no such tool for students to look into the courses provided by each university. One has to go website by website to see the information for 1 particular course to compare them.  
Hence, our team came out with the idea of aggregating all necessary information searched by students then rendering them in a neat and organised way. Here born the Uni Search.
Uni Search allows users to filter the options e.g. course, minimum CGPA, minimum Muet Band(English test for entering higher education) and location then see the results available for the course or university that they are looking for.  
The technologies behind Uni Search include HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, Firebase and Sheets API. Simple, isn’t it?  
As such, any student who is looking for information about a course or university/college in Malaysia can just go to Uni Search to perform the search and choose the course or university that best fits them, just within seconds!
